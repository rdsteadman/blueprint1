React Blueprint Test
====================

Created this folder by running `npx create-react-app blueprint1` 

Since I installed yarn, it seemed to use the yar version instead, and took longer than npm.
Also suggested a bunch of yarn commands instead:

	Success! Created navbar3 at C:\mydocs\React\test\navbar3
	Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

	yarn start
		Starts the development server.

	yarn build
		Bundles the app into static files for production.

	yarn test
		Starts the test runner.

	yarn eject
		Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
		and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!

	We suggest that you begin by typing:

	cd navbar3
	yarn start

	Happy hacking!
